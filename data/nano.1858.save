A classical **bit** can be 0 or 1. That's it.

A **qubit** is different: it can be 0, 1, or a *superposition* of both at once.

You can think of it like this:

- Bit  => coin lying flat: HEADS **or** TAILS.
- Qubit => coin spinning: it's sort of both, until you stop it.

Mathematically, we write a qubit as:

|ψ> = a|0> + b|1>

where a and b are complex numbers and |a|² + |b|² = 1.

When you measure a qubit:

- You see 0 with probability |a|²
- You see 1 with probability |b|²

But before measurement, it's in that mixed, “both at once” state we call superposition.

**Superposition** is the ability of a qubit to be in a combination of 0 and 1.

If we apply a Hadamard gate (H) to |0>, we get:

|ψ> = (|0> + |1>) / √2

This means:

- P(0) = 1/2
- P(1) = 1/2

Key idea: superposition lets a quantum computer explore many possibilities *at the same time* instead of checking them one by one.

Measurement turns a fuzzy quantum state into a definite classical value.

Example: if a qubit is in state

|ψ> = (|0> + |1>) / √2

and we measure it in the standard basis, then:

- We get 0 with probability 1/2
- We get 1 with probability 1/2

After measurement, the qubit is no longer in superposition. It “collapses”:

- If we saw 0, the qubit becomes |0>
- If we saw 1, the qubit becomes |1>

Quantum algorithms carefully control **when** measurement happens so they can use superposition and interference first, then read out useful answers at the end.

    content: `
**Entanglement** is a special kind of correlation between qubits that has no classical analog.

Example: the 2-qubit Bell state

|Φ⁺> = (|00> + |11>) / √2

If we measure the first qubit:

- With probability 1/2, we get 0 and the state becomes |00>
- With probability 1/2, we get 1 and the state becomes |11>

Either way, the two qubits always match. If the first is 0, the second is 0. If the first is 1, the second is 1.

This correlation is stronger than anything possible with classical random variables and is a key resource for quantum computing and quantum communication.

Let’s describe a simple 1-qubit circuit:

1. Start in |0>
2. Apply a Hadamard gate (H)
3. Measure

In circuit form:

|0> ── H ── ⟶ measure

After the H gate, the state is (|0> + |1>) / √2, so measurement gives:

- 0 with probability 1/2
- 1 with probability 1/2

In the playground, this will be one of the first circuits you run on a simulator and, eventually, on real quantum hardware.
